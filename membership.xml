                <comments>The .247 avg doesnt do him justice. he is more like a .300 player, but i think maybe more game time is needed. For playing IF, he does a great job. Really quick on the feet. Hope he returns next year. Go Mallards!</comments>

                <comments>I just found this blog. I probably won't be posting much as I am too busy hoing to the games to post about them. Seriously though... I cannot wait for the next season. My team is already out of the running, so I wait.</comments>
